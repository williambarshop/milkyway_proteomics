# Tool Versioning

Galaxy-P tools will have versions of the form X.Y.Z. Versions
differing only after the second decimal should be completely
compatible with each other. Breaking changes should result in an
increment of the number before and/or after the first decimal. All
tools of version less than 1.0.0 should be considered beta.
